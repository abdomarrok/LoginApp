This is a simple login page created using HTML and CSS. The page consists of two main sections: a description section on the left side and a login form on the right side.

## Getting Started
To use this login page, you can simply copy and paste the code into a text editor and save it with the .html extension. You will also need to create a folder called css and save the style.css file in it.

To view the login page in a web browser, simply open the HTML file in your preferred browser.

## Usage
The login page has a responsive design and can be used on different screen sizes. The page consists of two main sections:

### Description section: 
This section contains a welcome message and a brief description of the application. It also includes a "Read More" link that can be used to provide additional information about the application.

Login form: This section contains a form that allows users to enter their username and password. The form includes input fields for the username and password, as well as a submit button.
